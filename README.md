# responsivestorelandingpage
"I created a responsive store landing page for a watch-selling business using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The landing page features a visually appealing design with a navigation menu in the header, a product section showcasing six watch cards (each containing an image, name, brief description, and a 'Shop Now' button), and a clean footer. The page is fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing on both desktop and mobile devices. I utilized Bootstrap to enhance the layout and styling, providing a modern and professional appearance."
